##Data Destrciption

The data set used here is real estate data.

First of all, I tried to use Trulia API to obtain the mean price for some certain city in the US. Although I could obtain cities information for each, I had problems obtaining prices information for the cities. In the future, for the project, this problem should be handled.

Then I used UK's real estate data (price paid in house sales). Two data sets were used here: "Standard Price Paid Data (September 2015)" and "Yearly file: 2015". Both the data sets have the same data format:
The second column: prices
The third column: date
The fourth column: zipcode
The other columns are not useful in this analysis.
